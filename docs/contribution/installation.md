### Steps
You need to be in the [Roblox Group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/10495885/reimakesgames-dev#!/about) and have [me](https://www.roblox.com/users/309302130/profile) added as a friend.
Doing this will allow you to access the game. (Because roblox is stupid)

1. Clone the repository
	* `git clone https://github.com/reimakesgames/hybrid-conflict.git`
1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
1. Type `rojo serve` in the terminal
1. Open the game in Roblox Studio and create a local copy
1. Open the Rojo plugin in Roblox Studio and click `Connect`

You should now be able to edit the game in Visual Studio Code and see the changes in Roblox Studio.
